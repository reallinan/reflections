What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It will create a .git file in the directory. I need to init the repository to make the function of git available now.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It kind of offering a buffer area to confrim the changes. The work directory is lately updated version and the respository is the last version if the latest version is not commited.
