1, When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeeping all your work local?
I will create a remote repository to finish a project with others.
2, Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because you need to make sure the changes are needed to be updated to the local working directory.
3, Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are used to clone one respository from other people's github account to your account. Clone is used to copy one respository from either local working directory or github account(remote). Branch is used when you just want to try something new, experimental but still want to keep original versions.
4, What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
I think the best benefit will be you can still have one copy if the remote server is destroyed by some reason.
5, How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
It will be much harder if I collaborate with my teammates without git or github.
6, When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
When I want to try something experimental, I will prefer to make changes in a separate branch. The advantage of making changes directly in master is it will save a lot efforts and the benefit of making changes in a separate branch is we can try something new without affecting the contents in the master branch.
